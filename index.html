            <h5 class="header col s12 light">Introduction</h5>
            <p>
              Many studies have found that teaching Computer Science within a certain context can greatly improve students’ learning experience. In particular, teaching Computer Science within the context of robotics has been shown to be beneficial in many cases. The use of robots as educational tools is supported by the Constructionism theory of learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the use of robots as educational tools has been shown to be successful, prohibitively high costs still serve as a significant barrier to entry. Some of the difficulties faced by robot-aided curricula include: prohibitively high cost of hardware, appropriate choice of features to support the curriculum, and sufficient access to the robot. This project will design and implement a complete educational robot platform using only easily accessible, commercially available hardware and software. This platform is intended for use in the UCT CS1 extended degree Computer Science course.  While most related studies evaluate their success based on the difference in students’ marks before and after the addition of robots to the curriculum, this project uses other metrics (viz. student motivation, and system usability), as a long-running user study would be infeasible.

            <h5 class="header col s12 light">Work Allocation</h5>
            <p>
              In order to develop the larger RASPIED project, the system was split into three components with each component being handled as a full project by one of the team members.

            <p>
              This project involved the design and implementation of a complete edu-cational robot platform built using easily accessible hardware and software. The project aimed to answer two research questions and also consists of a software engineering component.

                <h6 class="minor-subheader">Research Question 1</h6>
                <blockquote>
                  Can an educational robot, along with a high-level programming interface, be used in the UCT CS1 exttended degree program to increase the motivation of the students learning basic Computer Science concepts?
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Previous studies investigating the use of educational robots in CS1 courses have found that it successfully motivates students; however, these studies generally either do not use validated questionnaires or do not address all the aspects of motivation. These studies also used a participant group which was not homogeneous and contained possible discrepancies in student ability which could affect motivation and interest when learning basic concepts with a robot.

              <li>
                <h6 class="minor-subheader">Research Question 2</h6>
                <blockquote>
                  Given a selection of cheaply available features to be used on an CS educational robot, which ones would students be most motivated to use, and which ones do students think would best help them understand the topic? Would these features be the same?
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In a review of the available literature, no studies were found that evaluated the effect on motivation of the individual features of the robot. This research question should help strike a balance between cost and functionality of educational robots.

                <h6 class="minor-subheader">Software Engineering Component</h6>
                <p>
                  The software engineering component of this project involves building a web app to support the robot. Students will use this web app to interactively program and observe the robot. Students will also be able to book time slots to access the robot remotely should they wish to experiment outside of class time.
